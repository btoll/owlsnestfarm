            <p>We started out as cat people; Ben had two when we met. Unfortunately, our jobs and our penchant for frequent relocations didn't allow for any other critters.</p>
            <p>Once we moved to Rockport, we realized that we finally had the time to expand our family. Since I had grown up with dogs, I was more than ready. Luckily, to aid us in the process of getting a dog was my voluteer position at <a href="http://www.capeannanimalaid.org/" title="Cape Ann Animal Aid" target="_blank">Cape Ann Animal Aid</a>. This amazing facility helps to rescue pets from all over the country, even Puerto Rico.</p>
            <p>Our first rescue from Cape Ann Animal Aid was our sweet girl Lily, a beautiful and funny five-year old black and white cat. Shortly after bringing her home, we lost our beloved Chuck. We knew no one would take his place as Top Cat, but it did allow for us to consider a dog, as before Mr. Chuck would not have heard of it!</p>
            <p>We stumbled upon Utley on Petfinder, and he was being cared for at Cape Ann Animal Aid. What wonderful luck! In two days he was home with us. He and Lily immediately became fast friends and still don't seem to realize they're different species.</p>
            <p>Soon we realized Utley needed a more rough-and-tumble pal to keep up with his puppy energy. I saw Molly one day while volunteering. She had been housed separately from her siblings because they had been picking on her. I called Ben and said we've found Utley's sister.</p>
            <p>To even things out, we felt that Lily needed a cat sibling. On another volunteer shift I met Rupert (Roo), and it was love at first sight!</p>
            <p>So now we had two cats and two dogs, all courtesy of Cape Ann Animal Aid.</p>
            <p>By now we were on the hunt for <a href="../farm/" title="The Owl House">an antique home</a> with some acreage. I wanted to continue learning and growing my garden. Ben and I had both wanted more space and to try our hand at "living off the land."</p>
            <p>Naturally, moving to the country meant we needed another dog, a larger, protective dog to look out for Utley and Molly.</p>
            <p>Along came Pete, our 110 pound rescue from the <a href="http://gdrne.com/" title="Great Dog Rescue New England" target="_blank">Great Dog Rescue New England</a>. He's been the best big little brother the others could ask for.</p>
            <p>Now, we wanted to call ourselves a proper farm and knew that just cats and dogs wouldn't cut it, so we now can boast of having the happiest flock of birds in New England! These include Araucanas, Buff Orpingtons, Hampshire Reds and Rhode Island Reds, as well as their good pals Mike and Ike, two male Pekin ducks. They are free range and organically raised!<p>
