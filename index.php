            <p>We like to think of ourselves as gentleman farmers.  We don't rise with the sun but we burn the midnight oil, a by-product of Ben being a software engineer and keeping atypical hours.  My excuse for being a night owl is good books and whatever my latest TV series obsession may be.</p>
            <p>After living in Pennsylvania, Arizona and California, we decided in 2012 to settle in New England.  We dreamed of an antique home rich in history, but initially we couldn't find anything that fit the bill.  We started our journey in Rockport, MA, and while lovely and charming, we didn't have the land we needed to support our growing family of animals.  So, we found ourselves again on the search for our dream property.</p>
            <p>Through a series of serendipitous circumstances, we stumbled upon the Owl's Nest Farm.  Within two months of seeing it, we were calling this amazing place home!  We knew straight away that we wanted to share the magic of our growing farm and <a href="history/" title="The Owl House">the historic Owl House</a>.
            <p>We are both vegetarians, and we support organizations that promote the wellness and well-being of all animal life. Among these are:
                <ul>

                </ul>
            </p>
