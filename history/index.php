            <h3>Historical Narrative</h3>
            <p>The history of David Rice was written by Peter Viles who has done extensive research on the Rice family.</p>
            <p>David Rice was born in 1757 in Rutland, Massachusetts, the son of David and Love (Moore) Rice and died in Princeton, Massachusetts in 1825, aged 68 years, 6months, 14 days. He was a sixth generation descendant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Rice_%281638%29" title="Edmund Rice" target="_blank">Edmund Rice</a>, one of the early settlers of Sudbury and Marlborough, Massachusetts.</p>
            <p>David served in the Revolutionary Way, enrolling from Rutland in August and October 1777. He was first in Bent's and Boylston's Companies (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparhawk%27s_Regiment_of_Militia" title="Sparhawk's Regiment of Militia" target="_blank">Nathan Sparhawk's Regiment</a>) and marched to Bennington, later claiming 102 miles for travel home. From 1 - 18 October, 1777, he served in James Mirick's Company (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney%27s_Regiment_of_Militia" title="Whitney's Regiment of Militia" target="_blank">Josiah Whitney's Regiment</a>; also under Lt. Col. Ephraim Sawyer), marching to reinforce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Gates" title="General Horatio Gates" target="_blank">General Horatio Gates</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Saratoga" title="Battles of Saratoga" target="_blank">Saratoga</a>.</p>
            <p>Although it is not clear just when he came to Princeton, it was most likely shortly after his marriage to Abigail (Newton) Read in 1785. Abigail was born in 1761, the daughter of Peter and Hannah (Child) Newton and had married Joel Read in 1782. Joel drowned in Muscapauge Pond in Rutland just a year later, leaving Abigail with an infant, a boy who was named after his father. Only 22 years old, Abigail probably returned home with her newborn.</p>
            <p>David's father had bought land in Princeton in 1772 and 1775, 180 acres of which he gave to his son in 1780 "for [the] love, good will and affection I have for him" in September 1780. David Rice's first homestead was probably the house on "the county road from Princeton to Hubbardston" known now as Old Colony Road and, earlier, Thompson Road. Blake, in his <a href="https://archive.org/details/historyoftownofp01blak" title="History of the Town of Princeton" target="_blank">History of Princeton</a>, states the house dates from 1785 and states was 27 by 36 feet. It contained 10 windows, double hung as 6x8 panes. This would correspond to the structure now at 113 Old Colony Road.</p>
            <p>Soon after David's arrival in Princeton, the insurgence of rural and western farmers and land owners made itself known in what was to be named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays%27_Rebellion" title="Shays' Rebellion" target="_blank">Shays' Rebellion</a>. Although popularly thought of as an uprising of poor and indebted farmers in the western counties, a recent study indicates the unrest with the Commonwealth government in Boston and its taxation and monetary policies was more widespread and involved many prominent civic and social leaders. Certainly the eastern Worcester County towns of Bolton and Princeton were regarded as hotbeds of support for reform, even violent reform. According to Blake, David Rice, while not a leader of the Princeton faction was certainly a strong supporter. It is likely he marched in early September 1786 to close the court session in Worcester.</p>
